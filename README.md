# Ride-share-company-Churn-Prediction:

Project Overview:
Ride sharing Company is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, they have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014.The data was pulled several months later.
Dataset Description 

city: city this user signed up in phone: primary device for this user 

signup_date: date of account registration; in the form ‘YYYY­MM­DD’ 

last_trip_date: the last time this user completed a trip; in the form ‘YYYY­MM­DD’ 

avg_dist: the average distance (in miles) per trip taken in the first 30 days after signup 

avg_rating_by_driver: the rider’s average rating over all of their trips 

avg_rating_of_driver: the rider’s average rating of their drivers over all of their trips 

surge_pct: the percent of trips taken with surge multiplier > 1 

avg_surge: The average surge multiplier over all of this user’s trips 

trips_in_first_30_days: the number of trips this user took in the first 30 days after signing up 

luxury_car_user: True if the user took an luxury car in their first 30 days; False otherwise 

weekday_pct: the percent of the user’s trips occurring during a weekday

# What is surge pricing?
Surge pricing automatically goes into effect when there are more riders in a given area than available drivers. This encourages more drivers to serve the busy area over time and shifts rider demand, to maintain reliability and restore balance.
For drivers, it’s an incentive. Drivers are notified in the app when demand increases through a map which shows the busiest areas and information about surge prices. The influx of drivers should mean there are more rides to go around.
For riders, it’s a premium. During surge pricing, fewer riders typically pay the premium. Rider demand decreases as some riders wait for more drivers to become available, and the marketplace rebalances.
Keeping it effective & accurate. Surge pricing works because it’s closely tied to the level of the marketplace imbalance. Here’s how we try to balance reliability for riders and drivers:



# Why surge pricing?
Surge pricing is a relief valve for the ridesharing marketplace. Without it, when demand for rides exceeds the number of available drivers, riders would wait longer (or might not be able to get a ride at all). Drivers would have less incentive to accept requests in busy areas. Surge pricing helps restore balance to the network. By waiting a bit longer, riders can avoid the surge price.
